# prompt2json

`prompt2json` is designed for composable command line workflows:

- Turn free form prompts into machine reliable JSON for automation and batch workflows
- Enforce output shape using a JSON Schema rather than post processing heuristics
- Make Gemini usable in shell pipelines, scripts, and data processing jobs
- Enable repeatable, inspectable prompt experiments from the command line
- Treat LLM calls as deterministic interfaces, not interactive sessions
